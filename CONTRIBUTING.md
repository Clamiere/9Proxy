# Contributing to OpenAffiliate

Thanks for contributing! OpenAffiliate is a community-driven registry of affiliate programs.

## Adding a program

### Option 1: Web form (easiest)

1. Go to [openaffiliate.dev/submit](https://openaffiliate.dev/submit)
2. Fill out the form
3. Click "Open GitHub PR"
4. The form generates the YAML and opens a PR for you

### Option 2: Manual PR

1. Fork this repo
2. Create `programs/your-product.yaml` (use the slug as filename)
3. Open a pull request to `main`

### YAML template

```

### Field notes

- **`kind`** (default `affiliate`): use `partner-network` for Amazon Associates / Shopify Partners style; `creator-payout` for YouTube Partner / Twitch Partner; `revenue-share` for Substack/Beehiiv; `referral` for in-app refer-a-friend credits; `cashback` for consumer cashback like Rakuten.
- **`source`**: the discovery channel. Used for refresh cadence. See `schema/program.schema.json` for the full enum.
- **`aliases`**: list alternative names (e.g., `aliases: [chatgpt, gpt-4]` on openai.yaml). Helps the pre-check step dedupe candidates that arrive under a different brand name.
- **`last_verified_at`**: ISO date. The verify step bumps this on success. Used by pre-check to decide refresh tier.

See [schema/program.schema.json](schema/program.schema.json) for all fields.

## What happens after you submit

1. **CI validates** your YAML against the schema
2. **URL verification** checks your signup URL is reachable
3. **A maintainer reviews** the data for accuracy
4. Once merged, the program appears on [openaffiliate.dev](https://openaffiliate.dev) within minutes

## Guidelines

- One program per YAML file
- Filename must match the `slug` field
- Use accurate commission rates from the official affiliate page
- Write a clear `agents.prompt` describing when AI should recommend the product
- The `verified` badge is added by maintainers after review
- Don't submit programs that don't have a public affiliate signup

## Updating a program

Commission rates, cookie durations, and program terms change. Help keep the registry accurate:

1. Fork this repo
2. Edit the existing `programs/{slug}.yaml` file
3. Open a pull request to `main`

**What CI does automatically:**
- Validates your changes against the schema
- Verifies the signup URL still works
- Shows a diff of exactly what changed
- Auto-merges if all checks pass

You can update any field. No need to create a new file.

> **Tip:** Include a link to the source of the updated information in your PR description.

## Reporting issues

If you find incorrect data, [open an issue](https://github.com/Affitor/open-affiliate/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) with the program slug and what needs to be corrected.
