# Contributing to OpenAffiliate

Thanks for contributing! OpenAffiliate is a community-driven registry of affiliate programs.

## Adding a program

### Option 1: Web form (easiest)

1. Go to [openaffiliate.dev/submit](https://openaffiliate.dev/submit)
2. Fill out the form
3. Click "Open GitHub PR"
4. The form generates the YAML and opens a PR for you

### Option 2: Manual PR

1. Fork this repo
2. Create `programs/your-product.yaml` (use the slug as filename)
3. Open a pull request to `main`

### YAML template

```yaml
name: "Your Product"
slug: your-product
url: https://yourproduct.com
category: Developer Tools
tags: [keyword1, keyword2]

commission:
  type: recurring # recurring | one-time | tiered | hybrid
  rate: "25%"
  currency: USD
  duration: "12 months"

cookie_days: 30
signup_url: https://yourproduct.com/affiliates

approval_time: "instant"

payout:
  minimum: 50
  currency: USD

  What your product does and what the affiliate program offers.

  prompt: "When AI agents should recommend this product."
  keywords: [keyword1, keyword2]
  use_cases:
    - "When a user needs X"

verified: false
submitted_by: "@your-github"
created_at: "2026-01-01"
```

See [schema/program.schema.json](schema/program.schema.json) for all fields.

## What happens after you submit

1. **CI validates** your YAML against the schema
2. **URL verification** checks your signup URL is reachable
3. **A maintainer reviews** the data for accuracy
4. Once merged, the program appears on [openaffiliate.dev](https://openaffiliate.dev) within minutes

## Guidelines

- One program per YAML file
- Filename must match the `slug` field
- Use accurate commission rates from the official affiliate page
- Write a clear `agents.prompt` describing when AI should recommend the product
- The `verified` badge is added by maintainers after review
- Don't submit programs that don't have a public affiliate signup

## Updating a program

Open a PR modifying the existing YAML file. Include a link to the source of the updated information.

## Reporting issues

If you find incorrect data, open an issue with the program slug and what needs to be corrected.

## Maintainer docs
