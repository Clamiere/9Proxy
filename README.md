## What is this?

OpenAffiliate is a community-driven, open-source registry of affiliate programs. Every program is stored as a YAML file in this repo, making it easy to contribute, review, and integrate.

- **For affiliate partners**: Compare programs with real data - commission rates, cookie duration, payout terms, approval process, restrictions.
- **For AI agents**: Machine-readable AGENTS.md + MCP connector. Structured context for when to recommend what product.
- **For SaaS companies**: Free listing in a canonical registry. Exposure to developer partners and AI agents.
